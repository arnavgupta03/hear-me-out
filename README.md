# Hear Me Out

A web app that allows one to listen to a slideshow in the voice that one intends.

HearMeOut is a project dedicated to making a better, and more beneficial online education system. In the wake of the novel Coronavirus, many countries have begun to use online learning tools to support children. The goal of HearMeOut is to benefit children who are auditory learners, and may depend on the teacher/instructor's voice. Through HearMeOut, the teacher/instructor's voice can be cloned, allowing the computer to speak in a similar manner to the teacher/instructor.

HearMeOut can also be used for children with special needs, who may not be comfortable speaking or presenting presentations. This allows such children to get the support they need and the education they require, through the help of AI and the web app.
